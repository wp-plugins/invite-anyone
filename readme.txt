Allows group admins to invite anyone to their groups, regardless of whether they're friends

== Description ==

By default, BuddyPress only allows group admins to invite their friends to groups. In some communities, you might want members to be able to invite non-friends to groups as well. This plugin allows you to do so, by populating the invitation checklist with the entire membership of the site, rather than just a friend list.

Because member lists can get very long and hard to navigate, this plugin adds a autosuggest search box to the Send Invites screen - the same one that appears on the Compose Message screen - which allows inviters to navigate directly to the members they want to invite. 

== Installation ==

* Upload the directory '/invite-anyone/' to your WP plugins directory and activate from the Dashboard of the main blog.
